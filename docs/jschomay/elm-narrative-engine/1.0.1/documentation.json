Rules are grouped into \"scenes\" for better control and organization.  If no rules match, the framework will perform a default rule, which is usually just to narrate the description of what was interacted with.\n\n@docs Scene\n\nYou build up rules via a declarative DSL like this:\n\n    storyRules =\n        [ interactingWith (item Umbrella)\n            `when` (unless (withItem Umbrella))\n            `changesWorld` [ addInventory Umbrella ]\n            `narrates` \"I always take my umbrella with me.\"\n        , interactingWith (item Umbrella)\n            `when` (inLocation Swamp)\n            `changesWorld` [ ]\n            `narrates` \"Good thing I brought my umbrella!\"\n        ...\n        ]\n\n@docs firstInteractionWith, interactingWith, when, changesWorld, narrates\n\n\n## Matching rules\n\nThe following condition matchers can be used in the `when` part of the DSL.  Note that you can nest and combine these matchers with `unless`, `all`, and `any`.\n\n@docs everyTime , withItem , nearCharacter , nearProp , inLocation , withKnowledge , all , any , unless\n\n\n## Changing the story world\n\nYou cannot change the story directly, but you can supply \"commands\" describing how the story state should change, as well as \"narration\" to accompany these changes.\n\n\n@docs moveTo, addLocation, removeLocation, addInventory, removeInventory, addCharacter, removeCharacter, addProp, removeProp, addKnowledge, loadScene, endStory\n",
