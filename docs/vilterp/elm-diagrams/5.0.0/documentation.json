These have multiple children which are transformed\nsimultaneously by the transformations above them.\n\n[Sierpinski triangle example](https://gist.github.com/vilterp/9966fd18de8d9b282ade)\n\nLastly, there are `Tag` nodes which just hold a child Diagram t and a value of type a;\nthese exist solely to identify a subdiagram, for the purposes of (a) specifying a tag\npath and getting the coordinates it was positioned at (the `getCoords` function) or\n(b) given a point, find what subtree it is over (the `pick` function).\n\nUsing signals to compose `pick` with mouse clicks, you can create a signal of\nclicked-on elements. Folding this with the application state and re-rendering, you\ncan make an interface which is responsive to the mouse without channels.\n\nThe library is based on the excellent [Diagrams][hd] library for Haskell, which\nhas a nice [visual tutorial][hd-tut]. Things are named slightly differently, and this\nversion is missing a lot of features and generality.\n\nWith v5.0 the functionality has been split into many modules to make it more manageable;\nthis [graph of their dependencies][mod-graph] may be helpful.
