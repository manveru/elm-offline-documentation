Make sure you use this one\ninstead.\n\nReason: The name `elm-oauth2.0` is used to generate a prefix in the corresponding compiled\nJavaScript. Yet, the identifier generated is an invalid JavaScript identifier and therefore,\ncorrupts the whole build.\n\nLesson: Do not use dot `.` in your package names (or any potentially risky character).\n\n@docs see\n\n",
