[{"name":"Html.Shorthand","comment":"Shorthands for common Html elements\n\n# Conventions\nThe following conventions are used for shorthands. One example is provided for each.\n\n## Single argument form\nThe attributes argument of the node is elided, with only the list of children remaining.\nFor certain elements where a canonical form is highly desirable, these functions have been left\noff in order to encourage more uniform use. For example, an `img` tag will almost certainly benefit\nfrom `src` and `alt` attributes. Some structural elements such as `section`, `aside`, `article`\nand `figure` should quite likely list an `id` in order to help users target interesting portions of\nyour website via a URL. Other elements, such as `hr` are not included in this list simply because it\ndoes not make sense to provide them with *any* child elements. In this case the canonical form is\nalso appropriate.\n\n@docs div_\n\n## Canonical form\n\nThis form attempts to take a common sense list of arguments. This is a limited form which\nwill not satisfy every need, but takes care of the extremely common cases. Many of the elements\nexcluded from single argument form is included here in a special form.\n\n@docs img'\n\nNote that `main'` is provided by elm-html, not by this package which only provides `main_`.\n\n## Classy form\n\nAnother very common case is creating elements for mostly aesthetic reasons.\nFor this it is frequently convenient to specify only a `class` attribute and not much else.\nThese 'c'-postfixed shorthands are similar to the canonical form, but also take a class string\n(a space separated list of CSS classes).\n\n@docs divc","aliases":[{"name":"TextString","comment":"","args":[],"type":"String"},{"name":"UrlString","comment":"","args":[],"type":"String"},{"name":"ClassString","comment":"","args":[],"type":"String"},{"name":"IdString","comment":"","args":[],"type":"String"}],"types":[],"values":[{"name":"a'","comment":"[&lt;a&gt;](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/a) represents a hyperlink , linking to another resource.","type":"UrlString -> String -> TextString -> Html"},{"name":"abbr'","comment":"[&lt;abbr&gt;](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/abbr) represents an abbreviation or an acronym ; the expansion of the\nabbreviation can be represented in the title attribute.","type":"TextString -> Html"},{"name":"abbrc","comment":"","type":"ClassString -> TextString -> Html"},{"name":"ac","comment":"","type":"ClassString -> UrlString -> String -> TextString -> Html"},{"name":"address_","comment":"[&lt;address&gt;](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/address) defines a section containing contact information.\n\nDo:\n* [place inside the &lt;footer&gt; where appropriate](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/address#Summary)\n\nDon't:\n* [represent an arbitrary, unrelated address](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/address#Summary)","type":"List Html -> Html"},{"name":"addressc","comment":"","type":"ClassString -> List Html -> Html"},{"name":"article'","comment":"[&lt;article&gt;](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/article) defines self-contained content that could exist independently of the rest\nof the content.\n\nDo:\n* [use &lt;article&gt; for self-contained components with informational content](http://html5doctor.com/the-article-element/)\n* [use &lt;article&gt; for blog entries, user-submitted comments, interactive educational gadgets](http://html5doctor.com/the-article-element/)\n\nDon't:\n* [confuse &lt;article&gt; with &lt;section&gt; which need not be self-contained](http://www.brucelawson.co.uk/2010/html5-articles-and-sections-whats-the-difference/)","type":"IdString -> List Html -> Html"},{"name":"articlec","comment":"","type":"ClassString -> IdString -> List Html -> Html"},{"name":"aside'","comment":"[&lt;aside&gt;](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/aside) defines some content loosely related to the page content.
