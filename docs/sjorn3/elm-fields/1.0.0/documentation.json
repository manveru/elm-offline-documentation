That is,\na module which provides first class field names.\n\nThese operations are intended for use with field names, but the types are\ngeneral enough for integration with other data types should the need arise.\n\n\n# Field Lenses\n\n@docs FieldLens\n\nDefinitions of the this type will be boilerplate. For example:\n\n    type alias Model {\n    field_name : String\n    }\n\n    field_name = { .field_name, (\\a r -> { r | field_name = a })}\n\nThis example leverages the fact that the field_name can be used as both the\nrecords name and the field, but it could be called anything.\n\n\n# Manipulating Fields\n\n@docs get, set, modify\n\n\n# Composing field names\n\n@docs compose, (>->), (<-<)\n\n",
